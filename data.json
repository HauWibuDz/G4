From the 28th night of the month Ashwin-October, until the 2nd day of the month Kartika-November in the Indian calendar. Each day of the festival has a different meaning and name. The first day is dedicated to celebrating wealth and prosperity, called Dhanteras. The second day is called Choti Diwali. And the main Diwali holiday takes place on Tuesday. The fourth day is the day to celebrate and appreciate the value of the relationship between husband and wife, called Padwa or otherwise known as Govardhan Puja - the feast of the Lord Krishna. The last day is Bhai Duj, a day dedicated to brotherly love in the family. One of the most impressive points in the Diwali festival is the house of firecrackers, people who set off firecrackers. Combined with the Diyas clay lanterns are lit, forming a festival of lights that is extremely glorious and brilliant. Thereby people aspire to the victorious meaning of justice."
